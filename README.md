Fitness First Fullness Predictor

This project is meant to always get the current utilization of the Fitness First Clubs (called "fullness" here for the alliteration).
Once enough datapoints are gathered, I'll provide a predictor for each club.

I created this project b/c I don't like to train when the club is too full, and I would like to have a proper prediction of fullness in order to plan my workouts.
